My tests and small projects made with Python

In this repo, you will find all the small scripts I created to test or learn some of python's characteristics. 
All of them will execute without a problem and I hope are useful to you, as they were to me.

This is the list of scripts and the concepts I was studying with them:
- date-modification: DateTime lib
- isinstance-test: verify the type of a variable
- query-dataframe: loading information from a CSV file and query on it
- json-test: testing the json lib with a small use case

All these examples where created and tested using python 3.10.2
